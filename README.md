### How to use

Run `./scripts/run_upload.sh <cluster-name> <date>` , for example `./scripts/run_upload.sh  devnet 2021-01-01`
and it will go through the entire flow in the reference tutorial.

I highly recommend trying with `devnet` and going through the `scripts/upload.sh` to understand how it works.
